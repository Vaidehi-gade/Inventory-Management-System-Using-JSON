# Inventory-Management-System-Using-JSON
This is a menu driven program.
Two different inventories are maintained using JSON. One for available products details and other for sales records.
Following functionalities are available in this:
1]  User can add an item and its details will be stored in recordInventory.
2]  If a user adds an existing item, its quantity will be added to existing item in recordInventory.
3]  When a customer purchases an item, its details will be stored in salesInventory.
4]  If a customer buys an existing item, its quantity will be added to existing item in salesInventory.
5]  If product id entered by customer is not present in recordInventory, "Item not available" message will be displayed.
6]  If customer requests more items that the quantity available in recordInventory, "Product out of stock!" message will be displayed.
